## Overview and Origin  

Fidelity Investments is a privately-owned investment management company which is based in Boston Massachusetts. The company was established in 1946 as a mutual fund company and is currently run by CEO, Abby Johnson. Fidelity’s main goal is to provide the financial planning, educational resources and advice that investors and newly starting investors need. This includes retirement planning, wealth management, brokerage services, college savings and more. The company is one of the largest investment management firms in the United States, with over 26 million customers, $6.5 trillion in total customer assets, and more than $2.4 trillion in global assets under management. (Fidelity, 2021)

The Fidelity Fund was created in 1930, about one year after the 1929 
stock market crash and a couple years before the great depression. In 1943 Edward C. Johnson II, who was a lawyer, bought the fund, which had $3 million in assets under management, and became its president and director. In 1946, Johnson II founded the Fidelity Management and Research Company, now  known as Fidelity Investments, to serve as an investment advisor to the Fidelity Fund.

It also offers Retirement Plans, Investing, Brokerage, Wealth Management, Financial Planning and Advice, Online Trading. (Fidelity, n.d.)

Fidelity offers an immense selection of assets, including ETFs, fixed income, stocks, forex, and mutual funds. Since the mobile app contains the same asset classes as Fidelity's web and Active Trader Pro platforms, aside from futures, futures options, and cryptocurrency, it is easy to place and manage trades from anywhere.

## Trading Technology  

Fidelity has an excellent trade execution, using proprietary smart order routing technology called Fidelity Dynamic Liquidity Management (FDLM), which determines the best available price. FLDM, which wasInitially developed for use by institutional clients, can access all types of market venues. This includes dark pools, exchanges, and market-makers, and Fidelity's CrossStream ATS. The technology can both consecutively access and spray multiple venues. (Investopedia, 2022)
Options in which traders using Fidelity can direct their orders to any of the eight available exchanges. While there's no direct online routing for equities on Fidelity’s website, users can direct orders through a representative. Fidelity users can also backtest trading strategies via Wealth-Lab Pro, a premium feature available to eligible Fidelity brokerage customers. One can execute a strategy trading in Wealth-Lab Pro if they qualify for automated trading, which requires having $100,000 in equity and placing at least 500 trades per year.

## Trends in Investment Banking Technology

1. Artificial Intelligence  

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the next big innovation in today's era. Everyday, AI is used to replace processes that were once performed manually by humans. As a result, AI, automation, and machine learning have been acquired in some way by most investment banking group departments. These firms use AI for deal origination, due diligence, company research, and to manage their networks. (4Degrees, 2022)

In a global fintech survey conducted by PwC, 50% of senior bankers state that they have made significant investments in AI platforms. The majority of their efforts are focused on productivity and reducing costs. Commercial divisions also use AI to service customers via chatbots and identify and respond to fraud. Due to competition from other banks, and a focus on maximizing returns, large investment banks will replace some back-office jobs with AI. (4Degrees. 2022)

Decision Support
One of the main uses of machine learning is to assist executives and banking teams in quickly analyzing large streams of data to ensure the best decisions are made. Using statistics, computer modeling, and historical data, these systems allow teams to focus on the areas with the highest yield or potential for risk. For financial services firms, predictive analytics aids in assessing risk and determining market movements. (4Degrees. 2022)

2. Unstructured Data Collection  

Most forms of artificial intelligence depend on large scale quantities of data in which the relevant models can use to refine their predictions. And so, processing, analyzing, and taking action based on first-party data insights is crucial. For example, once a firm has a few mergers and acquisitions directors, hundreds or thousands of potential deals will come across its plate. Managing those leads is precarious, especially if they come from an extensive matrix of relationships. If data is not used to analyze each opportunity quickly, lucrative deals could be lost. (4Degrees. 2022)

Furthermore, bankers often take advantage of secondary and tertiary data sources: data collected ethically through partners, customers, vendors, and public market information. These insights are used to identify new deal opportunities, grow networks, and ultimately increase efficiency and profits. Access to data and data analytics has also been a great equalizer, allowing fintech startups and other smaller companies to compete with larger and well-established financial institutions.  (4Degrees. 2022)

3. Virtual Data Rooms  

M&A transactions, restructuring, and IPOs require diligent document and data management systems which allow deal participants to manage and share confidential information. However, with cyber-attacks becoming a more common occurrence, it is essential for firms to take active steps in protecting personal data and sensitive corporate data. (4Degrees. 2022)

Securedocs says that “A virtual data room, or a ‘VDR,’ is an online database in which companies can store and share confidential information, usually used during a financial transaction. VDRs are also used as ongoing document repositories, allowing businesses to organize critical business documents for easy, secure access.” (4Degrees. 2022)

Banks and companies engaged in M&A transactions use data rooms to store and share vital deal making information securely. Everything is kept secure as a result, with access granted only to the appropriate parties, thus fostering higher productivity, enhanced security, and better regulatory compliance. (4Degrees. 2022)

Virtual data rooms are necessary for all firms, especially for those that have multiple deals in their pipeline at any given time. VDRs are powerful tools to keep bankers organized without compromising security when combined with the right relationship management system. (4Degrees. 2022)

4. Blockchain  

Emerging into the market thanks to cryptocurrencies, blockchain is a decentralized database in which data is stored together in block chains. While the ‘promise’ of blockchain is still mostly that, and has not become widespread in most investment banking firms and processes, there are numerous theoretical benefits that could be quite meaningful when realized. (4Degrees. 2022)
 
Blockchain has multiple uses beyond cryptocurrencies. For example, investment banks have piloted blockchain in compliance, AML and KYC. Some analysts have suggested blockchain has the ability to drive efficiency gains and reduce risks. According to 4Degrees, a report by Accenture says that implementing blockchain could cut costs and result in savings of more than 30% across the middle and back office.  (4Degrees. 2022)

Blockchain functions by storing information differently compared to a traditional centralized database. When the latest data comes in, it’s entered into a new block. The blocks are then chained together chronologically. A block must be in tandem with the previous and next block, which is confirmed by a distributed network of systems known as “miners.” This way, no single person has control over the database. Instead, it is distributed across all users.  (4Degrees. 2022)

Blockchain is ideal as a ledger for financial transactions because there is an unchangeable record of all previous transactions. Anyone can view it, but it is unalterable. Investment bankers prefer blockchain for two main reasons:

It can be used to replace mediators in fund transfers. Those players have their costs, which can be eliminated by blockchain (4Degrees, 2022)
The premise of blockchain is highly secure. Malicious parties can not change the ledger without altering every block, which is essentially impossible.

5. Relationship Management / Relationship Intelligence  

As a relationship-based business, bankers must rely on technology to maximize their business funnel while leveraging personal connections. With the right technology, banks can integrate their offline and online efforts to streamline business development, connect with key trading sources, and streamline trading processes.  (4Degrees. 2022)

Entering the Relationship Management platforms; these systems are  specifically designed for business centric teams to streamline their business development workflows and keep their networks working. For example, by identifying suitable investors for each deal and using AI to enable teams to mine the firm’s network for warm introductions, BD teams have the data they need to drive new business more effectively. By automating and tracking tasks and eliminating data entry, relationship management platforms bring value to other members of the trading team and free bankers to focus on productive work.

# Recommend to Introduce platform to Invest in Futures Markets:

## Benefits of Investing in Futures  

Despite the risks involved in trading futures, the benefits are immeasurable. Some of the advantages that make futures trading attractive are: 

### High Liquidity  
High liquidity means that futures are traded in high volume daily. A high number of traders means that market orders are filled quickly. Huge trading volume allows you to avoid price volatility. For example, you can close large positions without adversely affecting the price.

### Higher Returns
Investors with good judgment can benefit more from futures trading than from other investments. This is because they are essentially trading at 10x his exposure for spot trading.

### Stable Margin Requirements
Margin requirements are well established for most currencies and commodities in the futures market. Therefore, traders are  not confused about the margin to include in their contract. 

### Diversification and Hedging  
Futures are important financial instruments for hedging or diversifying a portfolio. By trading at different predetermined time periods, futures contracts automatically allow manufacturers and consumers to hedge in ways that accurately reflect their risk tolerance. 

### Low Charges
Futures trading fees are significantly lower than other types of trading. And the best part is the fact that these fees are usually charged when you close  a position. Most brokers charge little or no fees depending on the service provided. On average, the total commission or brokerage fee is only 0.6% of the contract value.

## Risks of Investing in Futures  

Some of the apparent risks associated with trading futures are:
### Unlimited Liability
Futures traders have unlimited liability. This means that you go beyond the positions you set in futures, unlike other types of trading where you only lose your tied capital. In some cases, you may end up losing more money than you have available in your futures trading account. 

### No Control Over Future Events
A common drawback of investing in futures contracts is the lack of control over future events. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes and political unrest, among others, can throw the estimated supply and demand out of balance. 

### Leverage
Trading futures gives you up to 5x to 100x leverage depending on your initial margin (a fraction of your total margin). This works best when the price is  moving as speculated and you can make a profit while making enough profit to cover the interest. However, if the price moves in the opposite direction, you will incur heavy losses.
